This is a brief guide on how to use testnet lightning resources at Plebnet.dev.

- [htlc.me](https://htlc.me) is a lightning testnet faucet. [Testnet.plebnet.dev](https://testnet.plebnet.dev) is a LNBIts testnet instance available to the public.The LNBits testnet account may also be used to fund a local LNBits development instance.
> **Be Sure to return your funds to the htlc faucet when you are done!**
- You can open a channel to our [Testnet CLN Node](https://mempool.space/testnet/lightning/node/03ba00a57cec1cef4873065ad54d0912696274cc53155b29a3b1256720e33a0943)
